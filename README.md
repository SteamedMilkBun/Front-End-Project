### This app provides an input box and search button.

- User inputs pokemon or pokemon ID#.

- Upon click or keypressing enter, previous pokemon data is cleared and an AJAX call to pokeapi.co retrieves and updates the webpage with relevant pokemon data. 

### Future features:

- interaction box in lower right corner similar to gameboy interface with 4 options, but

- instead of fight, run, etc, will have stats, abilities, etc clickables that display data on selection.
